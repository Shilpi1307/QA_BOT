# QA Bot with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
This repository contains a QA Bot built using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model architecture. The system allows users to upload documents and ask questions about the content in real-time. The bot uses the Cohere API to generate embeddings and retrieve relevant answers from a vector database.

Project Overview
This project implements a QA bot that can answer questions about uploaded documents. The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, combining document embeddings (retrieved via Cohere API) with a generative model to provide meaningful and context-aware answers. The bot can handle large documents and process multiple queries efficiently.

Features
Upload document functionality
Real-time QA system with accurate responses
Uses Cohere API for document embeddings
Efficient retrieval with a vector database (e.g., Pinecone)
Frontend interface built with Streamlit or Gradio
Tech Stack
Backend: Python, Cohere API, Pinecone (for vector storage)
Frontend: Streamlit / Gradio (for real-time interaction)
Containerization: Docker
Deployment: GitHub repository and Docker-based deployment
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Shilpi1307/QA_BOT.git
cd QA_BOT
2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Up Cohere API Key
You will need a Cohere API key to run this project. Obtain the API key from Cohere's website. Once you have it, you can either:

Set it as an environment variable:
bash
Copy code
export COHERE_API_KEY=your-api-key
On Windows, use:
bash
Copy code
set COHERE_API_KEY=your-api-key
5. Set Up Pinecone (Optional)
If you are using Pinecone as your vector database, you will need to initialize Pinecone with an API key. Follow Pineconeâ€™s documentation to set it up: Pinecone Documentation.

Usage Instructions
1. Running the QA Bot
You can run the bot either with Streamlit or Gradio.

For Streamlit:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
For Gradio:
bash
Copy code
python app_gradio.py
2. Interacting with the Bot
Once the app is running, a web interface will be available where you can:

Upload Documents: Upload text files or PDFs that the bot will analyze.
Ask Questions: Enter questions related to the content of the uploaded document, and the bot will provide context-based answers.
Deployment with Docker
1. Build the Docker Image
Make sure you have Docker installed and running on your machine. Then, build the Docker image using the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t qa-bot:latest .
2. Run the Docker Container
To run the application inside a Docker container:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8501:8501 -e COHERE_API_KEY=your-api-key qa-bot:latest
This will start the application, and it will be accessible at http://localhost:8501.

Example Queries
Here are some example queries you can try after uploading a document:

"What is the main topic of the document?"
"Summarize the document for me."
"What are the key points discussed in the third section?"
